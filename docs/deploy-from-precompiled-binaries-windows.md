## Summary

Use this guide to <a class="crosslink" href="https://virtocommerce.com/ecommerce-hosting" target="_blank">deploy</a> and configure precompiled Virto Commerce Platform V3.

### Prerequisites

[Prerequisites for .NET Core on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites)

[.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-windows-x64-installer)

[Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017-editions)

## Downloading the precomplied binaries

* Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-platform/releases">Releases section of Virto Commerce Platform in GitHub.</a>

* You will find **VirtoCommerce.Platform.3.x.x.zip** file. In this file the site has already been built and can be run without additional compilation. The source code is not included.

* Unpack this zip to a local directory **C:\vc-platform-3**. After that you will have the directory with Platform precompiled files.

## Setup

### Configure application strings

* Open the **appsettings.json** file in a text editor.
* In the **ConnectionStrings** section change **VirtoCommerce** node (provided user should have permission to create new database):

```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "VirtoCommerce" : "Data Source={SQL Server URL};Initial Catalog={Database name};Persist Security Info=True;User ID={User name};Password={User password};MultipleActiveResultSets=True;Connect Timeout=30"
    },

```

* In the **Assets** section set public url for assets `Assets:FileSystem:PublicUrl` with url of your application, this step is needed in order for display images

```json
"Assets": {
        "Provider": "FileSystem",
        "FileSystem": {
            "RootPath": "~/assets",
            "PublicUrl": "https://localhost:5001/assets/" <-- Set your platform application url with port localhost:5001
        },
    },
```

### Running the Platform by CLI "dotnet"

* Install and trust HTTPS certificate

Run to trust the .NET Core SDK HTTPS development certificate:

```console
dotnet.exe dev-certs https --trust
```

Read more about [enforcing HTTPS in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=visual-studio#trust)

* Run the Platform by following command:

```console
dotnet.exe C:\vc-platform-3\VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web.dll
```

The output in the console will say something like:

```console
Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
```

### First run sign in

* Open `https://localhost:5001` url in your browser. "Your connection is not private" might appear. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed to ...".
Read more on removing this error and using a self-signed certificate: [Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopingLocallyWithASPNETCoreUnderHTTPSSSLAndSelfSignedCerts.aspx)
* The application will create and initialize database on the first request. After that you should see the sign in page. Use the following credentials:
  * Login: **admin**
  * Password: **store**

### Host on Windows with IIS

The required web.config file was already included in the release package. It contains all the necessary settings for running in IIS.

Read more in the official Microsoft ASP.NET Core documentation:
[Host ASP.NET Core on Windows with IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/publishing/iis)

Open the VirtoCommerce Platform application in the browser.
