Open Web Apps and select your recenly created web app.Click on **Active Deployment** widget.In the **Deployments** list click on the failed deployment.In the **Deployment Details** click **View Log**.The most frequent error is related to downloading packages from NuGet. This is a temporary issue and in most cases clicking **Redeploy** in Deployment Details blade leads to successful deployment.
