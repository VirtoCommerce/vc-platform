# Welcome to v3.0
Meet the new major version of Virto Commerce Platform. Our development efforts were focused on moving to ASP&#46;NET Core, performance, architecture improvements and further enhancements.

**The changes below are a subset of the larger list of changes in migration to ASP&#46;NET Core.** 

# What's new
## Architectural and conceptual changes
### For developers and architects
- Improved extensibility and unification
- Increase in development speed and decrease in time to market
- Unified architecture and usage of good architecture practices leads to shorter learning curve for developers who are new to Virto Commerce
- Cross-Platform Support: run on Windows, Mac or Linux

### Technology stack
#### Application & Data
- **.NET Core** 2.2
- **ASP&#46;NET Core** 2.2
    - ASP&#46;NET Core Identity
    - ASP&#46;NET Core SignalR
- **OpenIddict** 2.0
- **Entity Framework Core** 2.2
- **HangFire** 1.6
- **AngularJS** 1.4

#### DevOps and Utilities
- **Docker**
- **npm**
- **Webpack**
- **xUnit**
- **Jenkins**
- **Nuke** aka **VirtoCommerce.GlobalTools**
- **Swagger UI**

### Techniques
- **Caching**
  - ASP&#46;NET Core in-memory caching is used
  - Strongly typed *cache regions* and *change tokens* for cache dependencies
  - Ability to manage cached objects' expiration time and disabling the caching
  - Hybrid caching policy for keeping cached data consistent in multiple Platform instances
  - The dedicated "VirtoCommerce.Cache" module was removed; now caching is implemented in place where it is needed
- **Dependency injection (DI)**
  - Unity DI replaced by built-in .NET Core DI (*Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection*)
- **Development**
  - Virto Commerce developmet switched to [GitFlow Workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model
  - [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion) tool to ease Semantic Versioning
  - Both Platform and all modules repository structure unified to have *build*, *docs*, *src*, *tests* folders on the top.
  - The recommended structure of a module solution was updated
     - *Permissions*, *Settings* and other constants should be defined in the *.Core* project
     - *Caching* should be defined and done in the *.Data* project
     - All v3 modules were refactored to follow the recommended structure
- **DevOps**
  - Nuke - Build Automation System for C#/.NET aka VirtoCommerce.GlobalTools
- **Dynamic properties**
  - Dynamic properties registration logic changed. Now manual registration used instead of reflection
- **Export/Import**
  - Export/Import is now streamed for all modules
- **Security**
  - Now permissions are defined only in design-time using a special fluent syntax
  - Localization for permissions added
  - Storefront switched to work using barrier token authentication
- **Settings**
  - Settings are defined in design-time, using special fluent syntax
  - Localization for settings added
  - Now setting value can be changed using any .NET Core configuration provider
- **Modularity**
  - *Module.manifest* file structure changed (scripts, styles, settings and permissions declarations removed)
  - *IModule* abstraction changed to have only *Initialize* and *PostInitialize* methods; *Module.cs* structure simplified.
- **Persistency infrastructure**
  - Object-relational mapper (ORM) switched to Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
  - New EF Core migrations generated
  - Only Table per Hierarchy (TPH, hierarchy mapping to a single table) inheritance model now supported
  - DbContext defined separately from repository
  - [EntityFramework.Triggers](https://github.com/NickStrupat/EntityFramework.Triggers) for auditing and change logging
  - Calls to DbContext methods refactored to be asynchronous

## Changes in VC Platform
- **Solution code structure**
  - Functionality specific implementations were split into dedicated projects (Assets, Modules, etc.)
- **Configuration and Options**
  - [ASP.NET Core configuration providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) used together with the [options pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-2.2).
- **Modularity**
  - Assembly and dependency loading completely reworked into platform process
- **Security**
  - Authentification and authorization fully migrated to ASP&#46;NET Core Identity without any extensions
  - OpenIddict used as an OpenID Connect server to support all OAuth flows; it's also used for token based authentication
  -  OAuth2 Password and Client credentials flow for Machine to Machine (M2M) applications
  - HMAC and simple key authorization support removed for API calls
- **Logging**
  - Built-in .NET Core *ILogger* abstraction and logic instead of *ICommonLogging* and *NLog*
- **Virto Commerce Manager app**
  - Webpack + npm instead of Gulp + Bower
  - New make-up for Commerce Manager app UI 

## New modules
- **`Notifications module`** (written from scratch)
  - Functionality, which was spread across the system, now gathered into a dedicated module 
  - Unlimited channel types for notification sending (email, SMS, social networks, etc.):
  - Notification availability management for each store
  - Possibility to activate/deactivate each notification individually for each store 
  - New flexible extendibility model 
  - Notification template preview with data
  - Support of LIQUID syntax for templates based on Scriban engine 
  - New notification messages feed enables to search and preview individual messages
  - Enhanced notifications management UI
- **`Tax module`**
  - Tax calculation functionality, which was spread across the system, now gathered into a dedicated module, responsible for tax settings and calculation
  - The new module is a single integration point for third party software and custom extensions
- **`Shipping module`**
  - Shipping costs calculation functionality, which was spread across the system, now gathered into a dedicated module, responsible for shipping methods, related settings and shipping costs calculation
  - The new module is a single integration point for third party software and custom extensions 
- **`Payment module`**
  - Payment methods functionality and integrations, which were spread across the system, now gathered into a dedicated module, responsible for payment methods and related settings
  - The new module is a single point for payment gateways integrations
- **`Search module`**
  - Provides a generic UI and programming components for indexed search
  - The new module is a single point for search engine integrations

## Major changes in modules
- **`Commerce core module`**
  - `VirtoCommerce.Domain` project removed
    - Now each module self-defines domain model and abstractions in corresponding `.Core` projects. Multiple packages from corresponding modules will be distributed instead.
    - Nuget package `VirtoCommerce.Domain` was left unmigrated from previous version. There won't be any migration to v3, nor any replacement package in v3.
  - Common functionality and model moved from `Virto Commerce dynamic expression library module`
- **`Catalog module`**
  - support for model extending added
  - `VirtoCommerce.CatalogModule.Web.Core` project removed. Model from `.Core` project used in API directly
- **`Marketing module`**
  - "Dynamic expression" building refactored to "compile time" expressions
  - New serialization logic for expressions. Serialized expression format changed to JSON (backwards compatible)

## Removed modules
-  `Smart caching module`
   - Now caching is implemented in place where it is needed (Platform and modules)
-  `Virto Commerce dynamic expression library module`
   - Common functionality and model moved to `Commerce core module`
   - Module specific functionality was split to corresponding modules (Marketing, Pricing, etc.)

## Platform v2 and v3 versions compatibility
### API
  - Both versions are compatible on API level. API clients should be able to switch between the versions only by changing the Platform endpoint URL and credentials
  - v2 and v3 swagger API specifications comparison generated by [swagger-diff](https://github.com/Sayi/swagger-diff) tool: [v2v3Changelog.html](media/v2v3Changelog.html)
### Database
  - The v2 and v3 databases have structural differences; any existing v2 database should be upgraded before using by Platform v3 
  - Automatic migration scripts were added to upgrade from v2 database to v3
