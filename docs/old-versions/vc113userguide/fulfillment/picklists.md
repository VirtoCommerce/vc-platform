## Introduction

When a shipment is ready for release, warehouse staff retrieves, packs, and ships the contents of the order. Warehouse picklists are tools to assist in order fulfillment.

Picklists are lists detailing which items to retrieve from the warehouse, and how to assemble those items into orders. The picker can limit the number of shipments the picklist covers. For example, while there may be 153 shipments awaiting packing, a picker may only want to retrieve items for the first 10 shipments.

The following details are included in the picklist by default:

* Order Number
* Shipment Number
* SKU Code
* Product Name
* Quantity
* Customer details - Name, email, and shipping address

Once a picklist has been created, the status of the shipment is changed to "Packing". A picklist is assigned to the user who created it. An administrator or worker can view the status of all picklists and, if necessary, to reprint a picklist.

Once a shipment is in the вЂњPackingвЂќ state, users may print a packing slip for the order. A packing slip is similar to an invoice, and is included with the parcel.В 

At this stage in the order life cycle, the funds for the shipment have not yet been captured. The picker must вЂњcomplete the orderвЂќ when a shipment has been packaged and shipped. At that point, funds will be transferred.
