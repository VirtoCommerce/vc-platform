## Introduction

A store in the Virto Commerce Manager is supposed as the web page (Storefront) that allows customers to purchase products drawn from a particular catalog. A default storefront is provided with the Commerce Manager. The store layout can be adjusted by editing special templates upon which the stores are based, but the most common parts of a store are configured through the "Stores" tab of Settings module. These settings include localization, taxes, payment gateways, customer accounts,В  and other system information to be set.

To find the block of store settings, open Settings module and navigate to "Stores" tab.

* Description (the description of the store, this field is optional and is not displayed to customers),

Here the currencies are defined as well. Just select default currency and define the list of currencies which will be available for customers to choose from.
