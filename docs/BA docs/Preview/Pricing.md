## Overview

*Describe main entities definitions, navigation, indexation, etc.*

### Main Entities

Pricing data are managed in Pricing module. Native VirtoCommerce functionality contains the following entities:

Entity | Description 
---|--- 
Price lists | A collection of price lines
Price list assignments | A relation from price list to catalog and users conditions
Prices | A value in the Price field in Priceline conditions for selected product
Price lines | A relation between product and prices with some conditions (minimum quantity, timeframes)

Each product can have a few prices related to different price lists. Each price will appear for product in the store if conditions are met. You can make Personalized prices with additional conditions.

It is important to understand the relations between entities:

Type |Relations
---|--- 
Price lists | (many) price lists <-> (one) currency; (one) price list <-> (many) price list assignments; 
Price list assignments | (many) price list assignments <-> (one) catalog; (many) price list assignment <-> (one) price list;
Prices | (many) prices <-> (one) price list; (many) prices <-> (one) product;
Price lines | (many) price lines <-> (one) price list; (one) price line <-> (one) sale price; (one) price line <-> (one) list price; 

Where (many)entity1 <-> (one)entity2 means that entity1 can be related with only one entity2, and entity2 can have many relations with entity1.

There are two Price Types with a different meaning:

Type | Description
--- |---
List Price | A regular price, specified for each product. 
Sale Price | A sales price, which should be lower than regular price. It has higher priority than list price, specified for each product.
