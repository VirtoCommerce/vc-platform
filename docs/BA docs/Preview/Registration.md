# Registration step scope

Account registration is a scenario that results with the appearance of a new active account (that can be a physical body for B2C case or a company for B2B case) in the system and the user who can normally act in the system on behalf of this account.

## Overview


### Main entities

Accounts data are managed in the Customer module. Native Virto Commerce functionality contains the following type of accounts and contacts:

Type | Description |
--- | ---
Organization | Represents a buyer organization in the system, an account (in business terms) in B2B case. Is a container for other organizations (brunches or sub-companies) and contacts.
Contact | Represents a physical body that can be an account (in business terms) by himself in B2C case or may belong to one or more organization accounts in B2B case.
Vendor | Represents a vendor organization in the system, can not contain other entities (vendors or contacts) by default.
Employee | Represnts the seller (system owner) employee. May belong to one or more organization accounts in B2B case.

It is important to understand that *users*, i.e. the security entities that has access to the web store is a dedicated entity, that is linked by relation but physically decupled from contact.

Each user is linked with the set of *roles* that define permission level for each store.

It means that a contact may be linked with few (any amount) users, where each user belongs to the only store.

Type | Description | Relations
--- | --- | ---
User | A Security entity that has access to the store according to permissions defined by a role | (one) contact <-> (many) users; (one) user <-> (many) roles
Role | A Security entity that represents a collection of atomic permissions | (many) roles <-> (many) permissions

### Indexation

Organizations, contacts, vendors, and employees are kept in the index.
