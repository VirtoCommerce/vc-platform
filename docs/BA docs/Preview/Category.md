Category |(many) categories <-> (one) physical  catalog; (one) category <-> (many) products; (many) categories <-> (many) properties; (many) categories <-> many tags; (many) categories <-> (many) properties; (many) categories <-> (one) tax type;
Product |(many) products <-> (one) physical catalog; (many) products <-> (one) category;

Where (many) entity1 <-> (one) entity2 means that entity1 can be related with only one entity2, and entity2 can have many relations with entity1.
