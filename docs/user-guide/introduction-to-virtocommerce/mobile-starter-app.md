It's preconfigured to duplicate the Virto Commerce storefront demo site [http://demo.virtocommerce.com/Clothing](http://demo.virtocommerce.com/Clothing). Create some test orders in the app right now and process them in Commerce Manager at [http://demo.virtocommerce.com/admin](http://demo.virtocommerce.com/admin) later.  
  
You can create your own mobile point of sale apps using our Mobile Starter kit. Check [Getting started for developers](docs/vc2devguide/development-scenarios/mobile-starter-kit-getting-started) guide for  technical details.
