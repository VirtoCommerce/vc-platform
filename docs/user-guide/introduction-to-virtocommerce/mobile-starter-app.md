It's preconfigured to duplicate the [Virto Commerce storefront demo site](https://virtocommerce.com/request-demo). Create some test orders in the app right now and process them in Commerce Manager [here](https://virtocommerce.com/request-demo) later. 
  
You can create your own mobile point of sale apps using our Mobile Starter kit. Check [Getting started for developers](docs/vc2devguide/development-scenarios/mobile-starter-kit-getting-started) guide for  technical details.
