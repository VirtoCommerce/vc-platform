Virto Commerce is an open-source platform for building extensible ecommerce applications. This includes complex digital commerce solutions for B2B, B2C, or B2B2C businesses, [marketplaces](https://virtocommerce.com/solutions/marketplace), and derived SaaS commerce platforms.

Virto Commerce architecture is based on such principles as Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless, and Advanced Extensibility.

## Principles
The main principle is to help the development teams focus on the implementation of business features without worrying about **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**.

* **[Atomic Architecture](https://virtocommerce.com/atomic-architecture)**: Assemble your scalable ecommerce solution by selecting ready-to-use modules that serve all your digital needs.
* **[MICROSERVICES](https://virtocommerce.com/microservices)**: Every application is built from headless microservices (modules). Applications and microservices are not limited to composite applications, they can also be used for building any other application and hence are functionally independent. 
* **[API-FIRST](https://virtocommerce.com/api-ecommerce)**: Ecommerce service with the right API design. All business logic is accessible via API, either Rest or GraphQL. 
* **[CLOUD NATIVE](https://virtocommerce.com/cloud-ecommerce)**: Ecommerce service is delivered in line with the SaaS model. This adds significant benefits for your business: 
    1. *On-demand*: Use the ecommerce service as a whole or its separate components as needed.
    1. *Scalability*: In the cloud, it can be easily scaled to support peak demand and long-term business growth. 
    1. *Reliability*: Leverage a solution deployed across multiple data centres and availability zones to maximize uptime and reduce potential revenue losses.
* **[HEADLESS](https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-headless-ecommerce-solution)**: Allows an enterprise to support omnichannel journeys across traditional and digital touchpoints as well as new business models.
* **EXTENSIBILITY AND [COMPOSABILITY](https://virtocommerce.com/composable-ecommerce)**: API model, persistence model, and business logic can be extended as needed without deploying or re-deploying the solution. This provides superior business agility and keeps you and your service up to date.

## Overview
The following chart illustrates the high-level architecture and main areas of the Virto Commerce solutions:

![Virto Commerce Architecture Reference](docs/media/vc-architecture-reference.png)

**[Virto Commerce Platform](https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-platform)**: Launches the ecommerce applications in the public, hybrid, and private [cloud](https://virtocommerce.com/virto-commerce-cloud) environments. 

**Commerce Applications**: API-based, modular and extensible logical set of one or more headless microservices (modules) with a focus on the implementation of the business feature, such as Digital Catalog, Order Management, Content Management, Marketing, etc.

**Custom Extensions**: Virto Commerce Module that enables extending API model, persistent model, business logic, and admin UI within the commerce applications.

**External Commerce Applications**: Third-party ecommerce applications and services. 

**Touchpoints**: Sell your products on the website, through a mobile application, chatbot or any third-party services: marketplace, dropshipping, or any other option you create. Virto Commerce Storefront Kit allows you to manage various brands and stores in the same environment and with the same features.

**Admin SPA**: Virto Commerce has an extensible and intuitive admin user interface, which allows you to manage data within your commerce applications across all channels.

**[Integration](https://virtocommerce.com/integrations/key-ecommerce-integrations) middleware**: Asynchronous integration middleware for declarative integration with non-real-time and legacy services.
